Carrying on the success of the previous hackathon, we held our second hackathon! This time we are honored to be invited by Choy Yuk Ying Bao, producer of RTHK, to work with [Erwin Huang](http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%BB%83%E5%B2%B3%E6%B0%B8), [Charles Mok](http://www.charlesmok.hk) and The House News to discuss the current situation of open data and open government in Hong Kong. In the discussion, Bao have a brillant idea that we make a budget calculator and see if this year budget will save more than old lady Wong from a supermarket! And we [made it](http://thehousenews.com/data-journalism/%E9%A0%90%E7%AE%97%E6%A1%88-calculator/)!

By the way, all our project is [open source](https://github.com/code4hk/budget2014). The code may not be the cleanest, so let's change Hong Kong while having fun!

P.S the show is [ON](http://programme.rthk.org.hk/rthk/tv/programme.php?name=tv/hkcc&d=2014-03-16&p=858&e=254599&m=episode)!
